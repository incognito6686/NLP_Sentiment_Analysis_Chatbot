# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis_Chatbot
This project presents the development of a Sentiment Analysis Chatbot using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. 
The chatbot can analyze the sentiment of user-input text and provide real-time sentiment predictions. 
The project involved data preprocessing, fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model, and implementing a user interaction loop.
